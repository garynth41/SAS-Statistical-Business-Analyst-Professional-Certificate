# Week 2

# Introduction to Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis Testing


# ANOVA and Regression
* Jordan Bakerman
In this module you learn to use graphical tools that can help determine which predictors are likely or unlikely to be useful. Then you learn to augment these graphical explorations with correlation analyses that describe linear relationships between potential predictors and our response variable. After you determine potential predictors, tools like ANOVA and regression help you assess the quality of the relationship between the response and predictors.

# Learning Objectives
Use graphical tools to explore associations and identify useful predictors
Perform a one-way analysis of variance using PROC GLM to compare the means of two or more populations
Perform correlation analysis to describe the relationships between potential predictors and the response variable
Interpret diffograms and control plots
Use simple linear regression to assess the quality of the relationships
